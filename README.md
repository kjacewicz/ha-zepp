### üì¶ Installation guide
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have a Xiaomi Band 7!!
You need to do some steps before, in order to connect it to the official Zepp App. I highly recommend you to follow [this guide](https://aguacatec.es/instalar-ha-en-la-xiaomi-band-7/).
In short, you need to modify the QR code of the bracelet to be able to link it with the application. In the aforementioned guide I show you how to do it easily.

#### ü™Ñ General steps
Again, i highly recommend you to follow [this guide](https://aguacatec.es/instalar-ha-en-tu-reloj-zepp/), since all the steps are more detailed and it is more difficult to get lost! Anyway, if you are an advanced user, just follow this steps:
- Download and install the official Zepp App for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huami.watch.hmwatchmanager) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/zepp-formerly-amazfit/id1127269366).
- Enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/1.0/guides/tools/zepp-app/) in Zepp App. 
- Build and install the ha-zepp application yourself using the [Zeus CLI](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/1.0/guides/tools/cli/) or the [installer developed by Barny](https://aguacatec.es/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/HA-ZeppOS-instaleitor.zip).
